This plugin should go into the resource/snmp_queries/ folder and loaded into Cacti the normal way.  It uses SNMP to poll SANs and report the number of discarded packets. This works with EMC and IBM SANs, I believe it should work with all snmp-enabled sans as I believe these OIDs are standards.

Don't forget to set the graph type to AREA when setting up the graph template. .
