Documentation
=============
Welcome to my documentation repo!  This is an ideal place to start to either find scripts I've written such as Nagios plugins and other miscellaneous scripts, mostly in BASH and Python.  I also have other documentation such as a cheat sheet for the i3 Window Manager, and emails I've written in the past documenting procedures.  Please email me at rob.berkes (my gmail acct) with any questions or comments! Thanks,
Rob
